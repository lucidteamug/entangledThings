   1. Rotation by Theta and measuring in the standard basis in the equivalent of measuring in the Theta basis and we will use this interchangeably. 
   2. Bell State
      1. Rotate both Qbits by Rotation gate, Theta then measure QBit A 
         1. Geometrically express collapse of QBit B 
         2. Matric/Mathematically express collapse of QBit B
            1. Disclaimer that any rotation by Theta of both particles, followed by a measurement will still yield |11> or |00> because rotating the bell state is a special 4D rotation that always results in the bell state! → Show matrix algebra proof
            2. Show a rotation by Theta=(PI/6) of both particles originally in the (½)[1 1 1 1] state to emphasize 4D rotations can (and usually do) result in a different output vector than input 
      2. Explain that if only  Qbit A is rotated by Theta, then the resulting vector actually expresses the possible states with QbitA in the Theta basis and Qbit B in the original basis (pencil in very clearly the basis on the vector)
